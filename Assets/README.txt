Created a save and load state using JSON and the scripts in the modules. The game will save the score, but it doesn't save the positions of the prefab targets.
I tried to debug it but I could not figure out how to get that properly working but there is logic in the scripts that I will revist. The save and load states for the score
will save the score when S is pressed and then when L is pressed it will change the current score to be what was saved even if the score was higher after the save.
